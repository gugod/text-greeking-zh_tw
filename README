    Text::Greeking::zh_TW - A module for generating meaningless Chinese text
    that creates the illusion of the finished document.

SYNOPSIS
      my $g = Text::Greeking::zh_TW->new;
      $g->paragraphs(3,15); # min of 1 paragraph and a max of 2
      $g->sentences(1,10);  # min of 2 sentences per paragraph and a max of 5
      $g->add_source($scalar); # use text yourself, not requisite
      print $g->generate;

DESCRIPTION
    This module is for Chinese speakers to generate vary meanless Chinese
    text.

INTERFACE
    new()
        Constructor.

    paragraphs($min, $max)
        Sets the minimum and maximum number of paragraphs to generate.
        Default is a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 8.

    sentences($min, $max)
        Sets the minimum and maximum number of sentences to generate per
        paragraph. Default is a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 8.

    generate
        Returns a body of random text generated from a randomly selected
        source using the minimum and maximum values set by paragraphs,
        sentences, and words minimum and maximum values. If generate is
        called without any sources a standard Lorem Ipsum block is used
        added to the sources and then used for processing the random text.

    add_source($scalar)
        Add text of yourself as corpus. Return instance itself, so we can
        add source serially.
